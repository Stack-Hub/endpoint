OF ACTION WILL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF 
FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY HEREIN IS A FUNDAMENTAL 
ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND REFLECTS A FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK.  
THE SOFTWARE WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS AND YOU 
AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS 
AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES SPECIFIED HEREIN WILL SURVIVE EVEN IF FOUND 
TO HAVE FAILED IN THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
